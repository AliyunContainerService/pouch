# Quick-Start

Two quick-starts are provided, one for end-users, the other one for developers.

As an end user who wish to use Pouch, please read [End User Quick-Start](#end-user-quick-start) to install and explore Pouch. 

As a developer who wish to hack on Pouch, please read [Developer Quick-Start](#developer-quick-start) to start hacking and get invloved in the project!

## End User Quick-Start

You can install Pouch automatically on your machine with very few steps. Currently we support two kinds of Linux Distribution: Ubuntu and CentOS.

### Ubuntu

To be added.

### CentOS

To be added.

## Developer Quick-Start

This guide provides step by step instructions to deploy Pouch on bare metal servers or virtual machines.
As a developer, you may need to build and test Pouch binaries via source code. To build pouchd which is so-called "pouch daemon" and pouch which is so-called "pouch cli", the following build system dependencies are required:

* Linux Kernel 3.10+
* Go 1.9.0+
* containerd: 1.0.0-beta.3
* runc: 1.0.0-rc4
* runv: 1.0.0 (option)

### Prerequisites Installation

Since pouchd is a kind of container engine, and pouch is a cli tool, if you hope to experience container management ability via Pouch, there are several additional binaries needed:

* [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd): an industry-standard container runtime;
* [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc): a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification;
* [runv](https://github.com/hyperhq/runv): a hypervisor-based runtime for OCI.

Here are the shell scripts to install `containerd` and `runc`:

``` shell
# install containerd
$ wget https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/download/v1.0.0-beta.3/containerd-1.0.0-beta.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ tar -xzvf containerd-1.0.0-beta.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/local
$
# install runc
$ wget https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/download/v1.0.0-rc4/runc.amd64 -P /usr/local/bin 
$ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/runc.amd64
$ mv /usr/local/bin/runc.amd64 /usr/local/bin/runc

```

### runV Installation

If you wish to experience hypervisor-based virtualization additionally, you will still need to install [runV](https://github.com/hyperhq/runv).

More guide on experiencing Pouch with runV including runv Installation, please refer to [pouch run with runv guide](docs/pouch-runv-guide.md).

### Pouch Build and Installation

With all prerequisites installed, you can build and install pouch daemon and pouch cli. Clone the repository and checkout whichever branch you like (in the following example, checkout branch master):

``` shell
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/alibaba/ 
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/alibaba/; git clone https://github.com/alibaba/pouch.git
$ cd pouch; git checkout master
```

Makefile target named `build` will compile the pouch and pouchd binaries in current work directory. Or you can just execute `make install` to build binaries and install them in destination directory (`/usr/local/bin` by default).

``` shell
$ make install
```

### Start Pouch

With all needed binaries installed, you could start pouchd via:

``` shell
$ pouchd
INFO[0000] starting containerd                           module=containerd revision=a543c937eb0a05e1636714ee2be70819d745b960 version=v1.0.0-beta.2

```

After pouchd's running, you could interact with pouchd by pouch cli:

```
$ pouch images ls
IMAGE ID             IMAGE NAME                                               SIZE

504cf109b492         docker.io/library/redis:alpine                           2035
```
