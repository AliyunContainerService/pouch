      summary: "Attach to a container"
      description: |
        Attach to a container to read its output or send it input. You can attach to the same container multiple times and you can reattach to containers that have been detached.

        Either the `stream` or `logs` parameter must be `true` for this endpoint to do anything.

        ### Hijacking

        This endpoint hijacks the HTTP connection to transport `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` on the same socket.

        This is the response from the daemon for an attach request:

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: application/vnd.raw-stream

        [STREAM]
        ```

        After the headers and two new lines, the TCP connection can now be used for raw, bidirectional communication between the client and server.

        To hint potential proxies about connection hijacking, the Pouch client can also optionally send connection upgrade headers.

        For example, the client sends this request to upgrade the connection:

        ```
        POST /containers/16253994b7c4/attach?stream=1&stdout=1 HTTP/1.1
        Upgrade: tcp
        Connection: Upgrade
        ```

        The Pouch daemon will respond with a `101 UPGRADED` response, and will similarly follow with the raw stream:

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 101 UPGRADED
        Content-Type: application/vnd.raw-stream
        Connection: Upgrade
        Upgrade: tcp

        [STREAM]
        ```

        ### Stream format

        When the TTY setting is disabled in [`POST /containers/create`](#operation/ContainerCreate), the stream over the hijacked connected is multiplexed to separate out `stdout` and `stderr`. The stream consists of a series of frames, each containing a header and a payload.

        The header contains the information which the stream writes (`stdout` or `stderr`). It also contains the size of the associated frame encoded in the last four bytes (`uint32`).

        It is encoded on the first eight bytes like this:

        ```go
        header := [8]byte{STREAM_TYPE, 0, 0, 0, SIZE1, SIZE2, SIZE3, SIZE4}
        ```

        `STREAM_TYPE` can be:

        - 0: `stdin` (is written on `stdout`)
        - 1: `stdout`
        - 2: `stderr`

        `SIZE1, SIZE2, SIZE3, SIZE4` are the four bytes of the `uint32` size encoded as big endian.

        Following the header is the payload, which is the specified number of bytes of `STREAM_TYPE`.

        The simplest way to implement this protocol is the following:

        1. Read 8 bytes.
        2. Choose `stdout` or `stderr` depending on the first byte.
        3. Extract the frame size from the last four bytes.
        4. Read the extracted size and output it on the correct output.
        5. Goto 1.

        ### Stream format when using a TTY

        When the TTY setting is enabled in [`POST /containers/create`](#operation/ContainerCreate), the stream is not multiplexed. The data exchanged over the hijacked connection is simply the raw data from the process PTY and client's `stdin`.

      operationId: "ContainerAttach"
      produces:
        - "application/vnd.raw-stream"

            If `stream` is also enabled, once all the previous output has been returned, it will seamlessly transition into streaming current output.

          push nondistributable artifacts to all registries whose resolved IP

          This option is useful when pushing images containing

          By default, local registries (`127.0.0.0/8`) are configured as

          Note that a running container can be _paused_. The `Running` and `Paused`
          booleans are not mutually exclusive:

          When pausing a container (on Linux), the cgroups freezer is used to suspend
          all processes in the container. Freezing the process requires the process to
          be running. As a result, paused containers are both `Running` _and_ `Paused`.

          Use the `Status` field instead to determine if a container's state is "running".
