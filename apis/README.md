# Apis

Directory /apis currently contains the following three kinds of things:

* API definitions via [swagger.yml](swagger.yml);
* struct in `/apis/types` used in restful API between Pouch Client and Server, both auto generated and manual added;
* api server implemented for pouch daemon.

## Generated and Manual Types

Pouch has both generated types via tool [swagger](https://swagger.io) and mamually added types. Currently both generated and manually added are located in directory `/apis/types`.
